CLI POETRY ANALYZER IN PYTHON
Project Overview
This project implements a Smart CLI-based Poetry Analysis Tool that mimics the functions of a literary expert. The program identifies rhyme schemes, meters, literary devices, sentiment, and enables comparisons between two poems. It is built using Python and applies concepts such as object-oriented programming, file I/O, regular expressions, and basic sentiment detection — all within a terminal environment.
